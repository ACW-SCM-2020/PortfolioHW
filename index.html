            <div class = "rightcontainer">My name is Andrew Wilkinson, and I am a part-time student in the UW Full Stack Flex Coding Bootcamp. After graduating college in 2012, I spent 4 years working primarily as a pizza delivery driver and then persued a Bachelor's Degree in Supply Chain Management from University of Washington Bothell Campus. Fun facts about me are that I have been an avid gamer since the age of 4, and I own an eight-string guitar. <br> <br> My primariy insipirations for coding come from my family, as my father is Studio Manger of Cat Daddy Games in Kirkland, however, I wanted to lean Full-Stack due to the languages being different than what most of my family knows (C++/C). </div>
